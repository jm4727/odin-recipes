    <h2>The Best (and Easiest) Ice Cream You'll Ever Make</h2>
    <p>Homemade Ice Cream is the quintessential summer treat, isn't it? This homemade ice cream recipe can also be called the easiest 
      (and best!) ice cream you will ever make or taste. I've been making this ice cream at least once a month for over 5 years now.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1¾ cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1¼ cup whole milk</li>
      <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean split in half lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour 1 cup of the cream into a saucepan and add the sugar, salt. Scrape the seeds of the vanilla bean into the pot and 
        then add the vanilla pod to the pot.</li>
      <li>Warm the mixture over medium heat, just until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and add the remaining cream, milk, 
        and vanilla extract (if using extract). Stir to combine and chill in the refrigerator.</li>
      <li>When ready to churn, remove the vanilla pod, whisk mixture again and pour into ice cream maker. Churn according to the manufacturer's
        instructions. Transfer the finished ice cream to an airtight container and place in the freezer until ready to serve. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
